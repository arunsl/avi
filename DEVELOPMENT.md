## Glossary

There is a **terminal window**, owned by the OS. It has a minimize and a close button, for example.

Avi has an **editor viewport**, and this should take up the whole terminal window. (Someday it might have **tabs** and or **splits**. (Who knows what splits are actually called?))

There is a **document viewport** inside the editor viewport, where the thing you're editing is, and where you can type. You can move around there with `hjkl` and stuff. There might be more than one of these. (See tabs and splits, above.)

Also inside the editor viewport, below the document viewport, is a **status line**. That's where you probably see the filename you're editing in reverse text, when you're working in Vim.

Also inside the editor viewport, below the status line, is the **command line**. That's where things like `:q` or `:sp README.md` will appear.
